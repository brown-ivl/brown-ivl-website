# About

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University. My research is in **3D computer vision and machine learning**. Specifically, I am interested in 3D spatiotemporal visual understanding of human physical interactions. I build methods for [human-centric](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/), [object-centric](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/NOCS_CVPR2019/), and [interaction-centric](https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/index.html) understanding of our world from videos and images.
