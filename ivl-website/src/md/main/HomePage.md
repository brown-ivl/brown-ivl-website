# About

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University. My research is in **3D computer vision and machine learning**. Specifically, I am interested in 3D spatiotemporal visual understanding of human physical interactions. I build methods for [human-centric](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/), [object-centric](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/NOCS_CVPR2019/), and [interaction-centric](https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/index.html) understanding of our world from videos and images.

# Prospective Students

**Prospective Students:** We are always looking for motivated students to join us. Please see [this](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/doctoral/) page for information on PhD admissions. If you are already an undergrad/grad at Brown, please email me directly.

# Other Work

Outside of Brown, I spend part of time as a Visiting Academic at [Amazon Robotics AI](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/rai). I was previously a postdoc at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/) with [Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/index.html). I obtained my [PhD](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/pubs/Dissertation_SrinathSridhar.pdf) at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) advised by [Christian Theobalt](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/) and [Antti Oulasvirta](http://users.comnet.aalto.fi/oulasvir/). I have also spent time at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), the [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com/home), [and College of Engineering Guindy](https://ceg.annauniv.edu/).

# Updates

* [ Mar-2022 ]: Srinath received the [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2143576) that will help further the group's research on 3D perception of human physical skills.
* [ Nov-2021 ]: Our new [report and companion website](https://neuralfields.cs.brown.edu/) provides a consolidated overview of coordinate-based neural networks (neural fields) in visual computing and beyond by reviewing over 250 papers.
* [ Oct-2021 ]: I helped co-organize the [Second 3DReps workshop](https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/3DReps/) at ICCV. The workshop recording is now available at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VKTE1Svl30).

# Collapsible Updates

* [ Oct-2021 ]: [HuMoR](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/humor/), a human motion model for robust pose estimation will be presented at ICCV 2021.
* [ Apr-2021 ]: Srinath received a [Google Research Scholar](https://research.google/outreach/research-scholar-program/recipients/) award to further the group's research on object-centric perception/synthesis for mixed reality.
* [ Mar-2021 ]: Our upcoming [ICRA paper](https://aadilmehdis.github.io/DRACO-Project-Page/) shows how to learn to densely reconstruct and canonicalize shapes with only weak supervision. Please see the [project page](https://aadilmehdis.github.io/DRACO-Project-Page/) for details, code, and data.
