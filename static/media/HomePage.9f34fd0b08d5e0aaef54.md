# About

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University. My research is in **3D computer vision and machine learning**. Specifically, I am interested in 3D spatiotemporal visual understanding of human physical interactions. I build methods for [human-centric](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/), [object-centric](https://geometry.stanford.edu/projects/NOCS_CVPR2019/), and [interaction-centric](https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/index.html) understanding of our world from videos and images.

# Other Work

Outside of Brown, I spend part of time as a Visiting Academic at [Amazon Robotics AI](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/rai). I was previously a postdoc at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/) with [Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/index.html). I obtained my [PhD](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/pubs/Dissertation_SrinathSridhar.pdf) at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) advised by [Christian Theobalt](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/) and [Antti Oulasvirta](http://users.comnet.aalto.fi/oulasvir/). I have also spent time at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), the [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com/home), [and College of Engineering Guindy](https://ceg.annauniv.edu/).
